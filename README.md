# Discord Verification Bot

A Discord bot designed to verify new Discord members by linking their Discord accounts with their Minecraft accounts.

## Features

- **User Verification:**  
  New Discord server members can verify their identity by linking their Discord account to their Minecraft account using the `/verify` command. Members have only 3 attempts; if exceeded, they will be rate limited for 5 minutes before they can try again.

- **User Unverification:**  
  Verified members can unverify themselves at any time.

       "verify_id": "<VERIFICATION_ROLE_ID>"
     }
